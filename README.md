## Twitter Image
This is a simple project which fetches tweets via Twitter API and displays the images.
There are two screens, including `ImageListViewController` and `ImageDetailViewController`.
The following are the screenshots.

I adopted MVVM architecture in this project and created a `WebService` class to handle Twitter API calls as well.
